/// that owns them.
///
/// The spacing relaunch wave has to bring every menu bar item back after
/// rewriting `NSStatusItemSpacing`. For an ordinary app that means quit and
/// launch the bundle, but a LaunchAgent owned item can carry a launch
/// constraint permitting launchd as its only launching parent, so launching
/// its bundle ourselves gets the new process SIGKILLed at exec
/// (`CODESIGNING`, "Launch Constraint Violation"). Those items have to be
/// restarted through launchd instead, which needs their label.
///
/// Ported from Thaw 2.1.0-beta.2 (upstream issue #720).
///
/// The label is read from the agent's property list and cannot be derived
/// from the bundle identifier or the plist file name: Dock's agent is
/// `com.apple.Dock.agent`, not `com.apple.dock`; Time Machine's is
/// `com.apple.TMHelperAgent`, not `com.apple.timemachine.HelperAgent`; the
/// screen sharing menu extra ships as `com.apple.SSMenuAgent` but is
/// launched by `com.apple.screensharing.menuextra`. Indexing on the
/// executable path is the only mapping that holds for all of them.
